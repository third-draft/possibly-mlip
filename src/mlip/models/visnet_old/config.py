class VisnetConfig(MLIPNetworkConfig):
    """Hyperparameters for the ViSNet model.

    Attributes:
        num_layers: Number of ViSNet layers. Default is 2.
        num_channels: The number of channels. Default is 256.
        l_max: Highest harmonic order included in the Spherical Harmonics series.
               Default is 2.
        num_heads: Number of heads in the attention block. Default is 8.
        num_rbf: Number of basis functions used in the embedding block. Default is 32.
        trainable_rbf: Whether to add learnable weights to each of the radial embedding
                       basis functions. Default is `False`.
        activation: Activation function for the output block. Options are "silu"
                    (default), "ssp" (which is shifted softplus), "tanh", "sigmoid", and
                    "swish".
        attn_activation: Activation function for the attention block. Options are "silu"
                         (default), "ssp" (which is shifted softplus), "tanh",
                         "sigmoid", and "swish".
        vecnorm_type: The type of the vector norm. The options are "none" (default),
                      "max_min", and "rms".
        num_readout_heads: Number of readout heads. The default is 1.
        radial_basis: The type of radial embedding. Options are "bessel", "gauss" and
                  "expnorm" (default).
        add_atomic_energies: Whether to add atomic energies to the final energies.
                             Default is `True`.
        num_species: The number of elements (atomic species descriptors) allowed.
                     If `None` (default), infer the value from the atomic energies
                     map in the dataset info.
        predict_partial_charges: Whether the model will be trained to predict charges.
        use_coulomb_term: Whether to use the Coulomb term in the model for long
                          range interactions. Default is False.
        use_total_charge_embedding: Whether to use the total charge embedding. Default
                                    is False.
        embed_activation: Activation function for the embedding block. Default is
                        "silu".
        deterministic_scatter_ops: Whether to use deterministic scatter operations in
            the forward pass, ensuring deterministic energy outputs. Setting to
            `True` makes prediction slower. Default is `False`.
        use_gradient_checkpointing: Whether to apply gradient checkpointing
            (rematerialization) to each ViSNet layer. This recomputes each layer's
            forward pass during the backward pass instead of storing its
            intermediate activations, substantially reducing peak memory usage
            (roughly 2x) at the cost of additional compute (roughly 10-15% slower).
            Recommended for large systems where memory is the limiting factor.
            Default is `False`.
